## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To make extension work you should set your OpenAI API key in the extension settings.

You can claim your OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

By default extension uses `gpt-4` model for code analysis but you can change it in the extension settings.

Using `gpt-4` model the annotation appears more precise but the annotation process takes more time.

You can also try the following ChatGPT models for annotation: `gpt-4-1106-preview` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`

To annotate the the code line just select it and wait. It will annotate the line and its context.
